# Service-Lane-algo
This code solves the Service Lane problem by finding the minimum width in each segment of the highway between given entry and exit points. It processes each test case by extracting the relevant segment from the width array and determining the narrowest point. The algorithm efficiently handles multiple queries by computing the minimum value within each specified range.
